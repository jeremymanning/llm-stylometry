Training Progress Update - 2025-09-30 17:06:46
================================================================

TRAINING STATUS: RUNNING ✓
Background Process: 7510ec

Progress: 100/320 models (31.2%)
- Baseline: 80/80 (100%) ✅
- Content: 7/80 (8.8%)
- Function: 7/80 (8.8%)
- POS: 6/80 (7.5%)

By Author:
- baum: 30/40 (75%) - Nearly complete
- Others: 10/40 each (25%) - Baseline only

Current Activity:
- Training: baum_variant=function_tokenizer=gpt2_seed=0
- Device: CPU (MPS/CUDA not available, but training proceeding)
- Speed: ~2-3 minutes per model

Estimated Remaining:
- Models: 220 remaining
- Time: ~440-660 minutes (~7-11 hours)
- Expected completion: Tomorrow morning

Next Steps:
1. Continue monitoring (python tests/check_test_model_progress.py)
2. When complete: python code/consolidate_model_results.py
3. Verify stats: python code/compute_stats.py --variant content
4. Run integration tests: python tests/test_variant_quick.py
5. Close issue #16

Notes:
- Training is CPU-only (slower but working)
- All baseline models complete and verified
- Variant models training sequentially by author
- Documentation complete (tests/README.md)
